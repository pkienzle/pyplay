Simple web app
==============

This directory contains several stages of a web app design, starting
with a simple web form growing to a single page app with interactive
plotting.

Python web server
-----------------

`<server.py>`_ is a simple python web server that handles cgi.

All examples are served with the built-in python web server infrastructure.
This is not usually meant for deployment for a variety of reasons.
Because it is run as a non-privileged user, for example, it can't open
port 80 which is the default http port, and instead all web links
need to use the server localhost:8008 instead of just 
localhost.

Chances are the firewall on your box will prevent external sites from
accessing port 8008, and you will need system privileges to enable
opening the port.  This is still simpler than installing and configuring
apache though.

Run server.py on your local machine to start the web services.

Traditional web application
---------------------------

`<index.html>`_ is a simple web form with a cgi callback.  

`<cgi-bin/hello.py>`_ is a simple python cgi script that returns a web
page, integrating some information from the form generated by index.html.
Note that the returned page is different from the current page, and
further queries will not be possible without returning to the original
form.  The back button will ask to resubmit the form, which is unpleasant,
and so a forward link back to the original form is provided on the page.
This fills up the browser history, so while simple, it does not provide
a good user experience.

Assuming server is running, use `<http://localhost:8008>`_ to test.


Single page web application
---------------------------

`<ajax.html>`_ is a simple single page web application, where responses
are pasted at the end of the page.  The page starts with a bit of javascript
to perform the cgi call and post the response.  I spent a long time
rediscovering the "preventDefault" action on the form, which resulted
in a lot of CGI errors.  The form does not do any error checking.

`<cgi-bin/ajax.py>`_ is the cgi backend.  It basically plugs the form
data into a bit of html and pushes it back to web page.

Note that if the browser does not have scripting available, then this
page won't render.

Use `<http://localhost:8008/ajax.html>`_ to test.


JSON data on server
-------------------

The web service can be more machine friendly by serving a JSON data structure
rather than an html string.  This variant implements the same single page
web app, except the html is composed on the browser rather than the server.

`<ajax_json.html>`_ is the web page.

`<cgi-bin/ajax_json.py>`_ is the cgi backend.

JSON adds a lot of flexibility, including use from other programs that are
not browsers.  For example, the curl program can retrieve the data from
the cgi server::

    $ curl -d "name=george" http://localhost:8008/cgi-bin/ajax_json.py
    {"name": "george"}


Handling graphs as images
-------------------------

For graphical data, you can compose the graph on the server side, save the
png file, and return a link to it to the browser.  This link can be added
to the page as a response.  Each generated image is tagged with a time
stamp in the name so that different requests don't overwrite each other.

`<ajax_image.html>`_ is the web page.

`<test.png>`_ is a sample image included so that this tutorial doesn't
need python plotting packages installed.

`<cgi-bin/ajax_image.py>`_ is the cgi backend.

Note that the resulting image is not interactive, and you won't be able to
zoom and scroll, or find information about each point.  Also, the image
directory will grow, and you will need a cron job to delete files older than
some age.

You could avoid creating a new image file each time by sending the image back
as png data.  Easy enough to figure out on the web, but not worth it compared
to plotting the data directly on the browser.

Interactive graphs
------------------

Rather than server side graphics, your users will have a better experience with
graphs generated in the browser.  There are a number of javascript plotting 
packages.  This example uses jqplot because I have some experience with it.  
Others work just as well.

`<ajax_jqplot.html>`_ is the web page.

`<cgi-bin/ajax_jqplot>`_ is the cgi backend. 

Before running this program, you first need to unpack the jqplot distribution
into your server directory and rename the directory from "dist" to "jqplot".

Tested with version 1.0.8 from
`<https://bitbucket.org/cleonello/jqplot/downloads/>`_

Note that the data and graph options are sent as a JSON string, so you could
have other programs consuming this data::

    $ curl -d "name=george" http://localhost:8008/cgi-bin/ajax_jqplot.py
    {"name": "george", "chart": {"data": [[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 1]], "options": {"series": [{"color": "#5FAB78"}], "axes": {"yaxis": {"max": 5, "min": -1}}, "title": "Title"}}}
