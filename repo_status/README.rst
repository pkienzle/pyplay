Repo Status
===========

Show the status of each repo in a directory with the appropriate version control
system command for that repo.

Usage
=====

::

    repos [path]

Notes
=====

Output is colorized for convenience.

It would be nice to suppress output if it is empty, but that is more work than I want to do right now.
